# Deployment of OpenStack and ScaleIO 3-node cluster in manual environment.
# Tested in 5 VirtualBox machines. 2 nova compute nodes is allocated.
# nova-cloud-controller, glance, keystone, cinder and mysql should be placed
# separately because they rewrite haproxy configuration
# If openstack-dashboard is added it also should be placed separately from these.

# Start with adding machines manually by "juju add-machine ssh:root@<ip>"
# Use reported machine ids to replace corresponding numbers in machines and services 
# below.
